  - Authenticated companies can post jobs, specifying job title, description, experience level, candidatesâ€™ emails, and application deadlines.
- **Automated Email Notifications**
  - Automated emails are sent to candidates with job details using Nodemailer.
- **Logout**
  - JWT-based authentication with token expiration for enhanced security.
